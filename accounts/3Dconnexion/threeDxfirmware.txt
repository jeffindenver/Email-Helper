We do have a new firmware version for your 3Dconnexion device which can be applied using the 3DxFlash tool. You can download the tool from our ftp-server using the following credentials:

ftp://ftp-de1.3Dconnexion.com
User: external-3Dx
Passwd: get.extra-sw

Please use the win32 version if you are using a 32bit operating system and the x64 version if you're using a 64bit operating system. Unzip the file and install it. Then open the Windows menu bar - in the 3Dconnexion folder you will find the "3DxFlash tool". If the tool does not recognize the device please unplug and plug it back in. Hit the upgrade button then. This should resolve the issue reported.  Please also refer to the attached readme file

Please let me know if the problem is solved or if you need further assistance. 

With best regards,
Jeff
