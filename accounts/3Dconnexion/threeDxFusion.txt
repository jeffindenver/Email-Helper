In the case of Fusion, Autodesk uses a second executable to run different portions of the GUI (for example the data pane where models are opened from).  As this profile is for a non 3D mouse enabled application, it is only emulating the mouse scroll wheel with the tilt axis, which in the case of Fusion is the zoom function.  

Can you please try copying the “Fusion_Ignore.xml” file from within the attached zip folder to this folder location on your machine:  

“%APPDATA%\3Dconnexion\3DxWare\Cfg”

This tells the driver to ignore this executable.
